###Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using the California housing dataset **(housing.csv)**. Various machine learning models have been employed, including Linear Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.

###Dataset

The California housing dataset contains housing data for districts in California, with features such as median income, housing median age, average rooms, etc. The target variable is the median house value for California districts.

###Models Used and It's accuracy
